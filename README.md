Welcome to To-C-Shop! This is a simple console-based shopping list manager implemented in C. This program allows you to efficiently manage your shopping list with options to add items, show the list, and more.

## Features

1. Add items: Add items to your shopping list with the name, quantity, and approximate price.
2. Show list: Display the current items in your shopping list.
3. Remove items: Functionality to remove or mark items (not implemented yet).
4. Search list: Functionality to search items (not implemented yet).
   Exit: Exit the program gracefully.

## C Language Features Used

This project utilizes several features of the C programming language:

1. Dynamic Memory Management: malloc and realloc are used for dynamic memory allocation.
2. Structs: The struct keyword is used to define a composite data type for storing shopping list items.

## Future Improvements

Implement the functions to remove items from the list.
Implement the search functionality to find specific items.
Improve the user interface and add more features as needed.

Some of the features are not implemented yet and still on progress.
