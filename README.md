## To-C-Shop

I create this program and call it To-C-Shop because this is a simple console-based shopping list manager implemented in C & this program allows you to efficiently manage your shopping list with options to add items, show the list, and more.

## Features

1. Add items: Add items to your shopping list with the name, quantity, and approximate price.
2. Show list: Display the current items in your shopping list.
3. Remove items: Functionality to remove or mark items (not implemented yet).
4. Search list: Functionality to search items (not implemented yet).

## C Language Features Used

This project utilizes several features of the C programming language:

1. Dynamic Memory Management: malloc and realloc are used for dynamic memory allocation.
2. Structs: The struct keyword is used to define a composite data type for storing shopping list items.

## Future Improvements

Some of the features are not implemented yet and still on progress :
Implement the functions to remove items from the list.
Implement the search functionality to find specific items.
Improve the user interface and add more features as needed.
